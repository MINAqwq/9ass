I made these scripts to install software i frequently use on plan9.

Usage:
./9ASS [name | all]

if you run it without argument it will search the binaries in your
system and install only what it missing.

"All" as argument will refetch and install everything.

Software:
- netsurf | webbrowser
- treason | video player
